Lite version of Wolf Vollprecht's UberWriter

Code is based on [UberWriter](https://launchpad.net/uberwriter) / [commit 93](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~w-vollprecht/uberwriter/quickly_trunk/files/93) which seems to be quite abandoned.

I wanto to create lite version with just markdown editor without export to other file formats. Those export dependencies add lot of weight which I don't need.
